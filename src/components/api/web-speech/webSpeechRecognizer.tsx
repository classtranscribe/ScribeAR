/**
 * A SpeechRecognition recognizer yields an array of blocks, each containing a transcript string, a final / in-progress bit, and some extra info
 * 
 * Whenever the array is updated, a recognized event is triggered. A recognized event is also triggered when the recognizer
 * Receives the stop signal, as the in-progress blocks are forced to be finalized before stopping the recognizer.
 * 
 * If we conceptualize it as an array of final blocks and an array of in progress blocks, then they obey
 * these invariants:
 * 
 * 1. The array of final blocks is append-only, array_old is a prefix of array_new
 * 2. The array of in-progress blocks can only contain 0-2 blocks
 * 3. Both arrays are emptied when the recognier starts / restarts
 * 4. The in-progress array is empty in the last array update event immediately before the recognizer stops
